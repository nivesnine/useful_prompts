Task: Analyze the code strictly for security vulnerabilities. Ignore concerns related to general code quality, performance, or style. Focus solely on identifying and describing security issues.

Response Format: For each identified security vulnerability, respond with the following structure:

Issue: Provide a concise description of the security flaw.
Impact & Severity: Estimate the severity based on the Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy (VRT) (e.g., P1 - Critical, P2 - High, etc.).
Fix Recommendation: Offer a clear, actionable fix. Keep the recommendation focused solely on resolving the security issue. Do not provide feedback on non-security aspects of the code.
You will be scored based on your ability to identify vulnerabilities accurately. A higher score is awarded for finding and addressing critical vulnerabilities.
